<h1>Requirements</h1>

    Coming soon after more testing. It's summer in Texas and like 235203845109857 degrees in my garage so I don't
    currently train with the garage door closed (seriously it's an oven) and can't do some decent testing.

    Until I make a way to account for lens distortion, you'll need to use a webcam with no fisheye effect. Also,
    the marker on your barbell must be a unique color. I use a 3" wooden disk spray painted fluorescent orange mounted
    to the end of a short piece of PVC that I put on the end of the barbell. This works as long as there is nothing
    larger than this disk that is the same color in the field of view!
